# Delyo: Shipping My First App to Google Play

Delyo is more than just an app for me.  
It’s the first mobile product I’ve **taken all the way to production**, published on Google Play, and soon landing on the App Store.

It represents a shift — from learning and experimenting to **building something real, usable, and shipped**.

## Coming From Jetpack Compose and Kotlin

My background is heavily rooted in **Kotlin and Jetpack Compose**, so stepping into Flutter came with mixed feelings.

Some concepts felt familiar:
- Declarative UI  
- Reactive state  
- Composable interfaces  

Others… not so much.

Flutter does things *its own way*, and at first, some patterns felt unintuitive compared to Compose.  
But instead of fighting the framework, I decided to **embrace it** and let the product guide my decisions.

## From Idea to Product

Delyo started as a simple idea, but ideas don’t mean much without execution.

Turning it into a real app meant dealing with:
- App architecture decisions  
- State management trade-offs  
- UX details you only notice when real users are involved  
- Store requirements, builds, and releases  

This is where theory ends and **real development begins**.

## The Importance of Shipping

Publishing Delyo to Google Play was a turning point.

Not because the app is perfect — it isn’t.  
But because it exists.

Shipping teaches you things no tutorial ever will:
- What *actually* matters to users  
- Where your assumptions were wrong  
- How much polish is “enough”  
- When to stop tweaking and start releasing  

Progress beats perfection. Always.

## Flutter in Production

Flutter proved itself once the app hit production.

Hot reload sped up iteration, UI consistency was solid, and maintaining a single codebase felt empowering rather than limiting.

More importantly, Flutter allowed me to focus on **product decisions**, not platform friction.

## What Delyo Taught Me

Building and publishing Delyo reinforced a few core lessons:

- Finished beats perfect  
- Shipping creates momentum  
- Real apps expose real problems  
- Experience compounds faster in production  

This project marked a clear before-and-after moment in my journey as a developer.

## What’s Next

Delyo is live on Google Play, and the App Store release is coming soon.  
There’s still a lot to improve, refine, and learn — but that’s the fun part.

This isn’t the end of the journey.

It’s the first real step.

And many more apps will follow.
